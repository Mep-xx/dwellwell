--General
The Site title doesn't change while navigating around
Having an expired token doesn't redirect to the login page

--Dashboard

Snoozing updates the date but not visually in the UI

Skip isn't hooked up right



--Trackables
All trackable "Type" should have a default image.  For example, "Coffee Maker" should have an icon until I add the actual picture.

Trackables, when added, should include the image set for the trackable (so if i go and add it to the compliance catalog, it should reflect in the trackable)

"Show Tasks" shows "Show Tasks (0)" when they're created, but expands properly

--Tasks

Tasks should show the recurrence interval

Tasks should have a category so if you never want to see "cleaning" tasks, you don't need to.  Come up with categories.

Tasks should be something you can completely dismiss, right now it's just "complete, skip, remind"

Tasks detail screen needs to be created.

--Homes

Changing the type of house you have from the edit screen should load rooms (if you have no rooms present, or should give you the option to clear your existing rooms and load from a template).

Quick Add should give more of an option to fill in details so they don't just add a dishwasher then forget about it.

Deleting home should cascade delete all user tasks related to that home and trackable association with that home.  (think like moving and bringing your stuff with you)

--Rooms

Adding a trackable from a room should give you a list of your existing Trackables or ask you if you want a new one.

The alignment is weird here

--Seeds
Review seeds, I don't think we should add things like dishwasher tasks until they choose that they have one.

--Admin Task Templates
The edit popup needs to be remade.
